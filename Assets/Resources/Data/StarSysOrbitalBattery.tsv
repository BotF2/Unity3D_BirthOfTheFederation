0	100	4	Orbital Batteries	fed_orbital_battery	0	4	2	Orbital batteries are mainly a defensive measure but can be used to blockade of a wormhole or transwarp hub. Their effectiveness is maximized when used in conjunction with other defensive systems, but they are vulnerable to tactics such as sabotage, coordinated fleet action, or the exploitation of weak points (e.g., power sources or control systems).
