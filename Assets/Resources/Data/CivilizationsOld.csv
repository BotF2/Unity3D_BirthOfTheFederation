The people of the Federation live in a society based on the values of liberty and equality. Their strength lies in extremely effective research, which grants them fast access to new technologies. Their high-quality products come at the expense of high resource costs, however. Because of their moral convictions, they quickly show weaknesses in the field of espionage and sabotage by Starfleet intelligence. However when under attack, some citizens of the Federation were known to effectively change their attitude to the ends justify the means. With a fleet of well-rounded starships, the Federation is equally likely to be seen conducting trade, exploration, humanitarian, and diplomatic missions, as they are to be seen conducting military patrols and combat maneuvers.

To the Romulans, however, other races have hardly any mystery left, for their talented intelligence agency, the Tal Shiar, has solved each of those mysteries. Romulan interests are protected by a veil of secrecy and covertness, just as their ships are hidden from prying eyes by powerful cloaking technologies. Their ships move undetected in groups until they are close to their unsuspecting victim, before decloaking and destroying their target in the ambush. Reports on Romulan society show it functions on exceptional research achievements. The basic supply of energy and food for the populace is sufficient to meet day-to-day needs, and is rigorously regulated to be resource-saving, as are their fleet maintenance costs; Romulan fleets expect to decimate the enemy before they have any chance at mounting a defense. In the 24th century, the Romulans became famous for their powerful and cost/performance efficient D'deridex class warbirds, which can however be build only slowly, so you shouldn't start a long, or even a multi-border war.

Their quest for glory and honor in battle makes them masters in the field of combat; be it in ground or space-based combat, their weapons arm quickly and strike hard. Some of their warships possess cloaking devices, with which the Klingons strike from the shadows at their prey. Their vigorous industrial forges process countless masses of raw materials, keeping their resource-hungry war machine running, whilst gigantic hunting parties guarantee the population's food supply. However, all things that do not directly serve battle are of lower importance to them and thus are less effective. The Klingons consider espionage a cowardly and dishonorable act, but are willing to defend themselves through internal security as necessary. Since Klingon engineers and scientists are not that qualified, you better conquer other words in order not to fall behind, in comparison to other empires. Minor empires, especially other warmongers respect the Klingon Empire. WHEN FOLLOWING THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, EVERYDAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!"

The Changeling shape-shift to any form, which makes them very good in espionage. If working, the Dominion also uses the diplomatic skill of cunning Vorta to create valuable alliances and persuade minors to join them, without a fight. The Jem´hadar, dependent on Ketracel-While, are among the best ground troops an empire can have and are sent if diplomacy fails. After 2000 years of Dominion rule without challengers, there are no species especially skilled in technological advancement, which is the biggest flaw of this empire.

When the Borg encounters other species and new technologies, they will assimilate both the crew and the ship as well, adding their distinctiveness to their own.
