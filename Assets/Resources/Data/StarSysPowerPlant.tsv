0	100	0	Antimatter Plasma Reactors	fed_plasma_reactor	0	10	20	In the presence of warp plasma, hydrogen is converted completely and efficiently to energy. The Plasma Reactor uses a fully-contained bubble of warp plasma as a catalyst, and converts hydrogen to energy more efficiently than a simple fusion reactor.
1	100	0	Singularity Reactorsrom_singularity_plant	0	10	20	Romulan singularity power source is a highly advanced and fictional energy generation system based on the use of an artificial quantum singularity (essentially, a contained black hole).
2	100	0	Matter Furnace	kling_matter_antimatter_reactor	0	10	20	Klingon power sources are primarily based on matter-antimatter reactors, similar to the Federation's warp cores. However, Klingon technology and engineering practices reflect their cultural priorities of ruggedness, simplicity, and combat efficiency, making their systems distinct in design and operation.
3	100	0	Fusion Reactors	card_fusion_plant	0	5	10	Cardassian fusion reactors utilize the hydrogen isotopes Tritium. Radioactive isotopes are bred from lithium in the reactor. Extreme temperatures and pressure in a confinement chamber allows for efficient energy is extraction.
4	100	0	Polaron Power Stations	dom_quantum_reactor	0	15	30	The Dominionâ€™s power sources are likely built around matter-antimatter reactors, polaron energy systems, and potentially exotic Gamma Quadrant technologies. Their integration of biomechanical engineering and focus on militaristic efficiency ensures their power systems are highly reliable and optimized for large-scale operations.
5	100	0	Power Nodes	borg_particle_reactor	0	20	40	The Borg power source is likely a combination of plasma energy systems, subspace energy tapping, and fusion/antimatter technology, enhanced by their adaptive and nanotechnological advancements. Their energy systems are built for scalability, redundancy, and the ability to assimilate superior technologies. This allows the Borg to sustain their operations across the galaxy without significant limitations.
