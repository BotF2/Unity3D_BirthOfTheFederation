  Description: "The Dominion\u2019s power sources are likely built around matter-antimatter
    reactors, polaron energy systems, and potentially exotic Gamma Quadrant technologies.
    Their integration of biomechanical engineering and focus on militaristic efficiency
    ensures their power systems are highly reliable and optimized for large-scale
    operations."
