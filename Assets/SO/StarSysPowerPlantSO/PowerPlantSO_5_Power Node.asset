  Description: The Borg power source is likely a combination of plasma energy systems,
    subspace energy tapping, and fusion/antimatter technology, enhanced by their
    adaptive and nanotechnological advancements. Their energy systems are built for
    scalability, redundancy, and the ability to assimilate superior technologies.
    This allows the Borg to sustain their operations across the galaxy without significant
    limitations.
