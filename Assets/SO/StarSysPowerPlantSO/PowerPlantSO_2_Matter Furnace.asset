  Description: Klingon power sources are primarily based on matter-antimatter reactors,
    similar to the Federation's warp cores. However, Klingon technology and engineering
    practices reflect their cultural priorities of ruggedness, simplicity, and combat
    efficiency, making their systems distinct in design and operation.
