  Decription: The Ferengi are a race of hucksters, living for material wealth and
    possessions, and the constant desire to acquire more by any means necessary.
    Their traders can be found across most of the known galaxy, and their trading
    fleet is an unparalleled economic force. But the Ferengi cannot be trusted, and
    it will be difficult to maintain political links without a financial incentive
    to keep their interest. The potential boon to our economy that Ferengi membership
    would bring cannot be overstated, however.
