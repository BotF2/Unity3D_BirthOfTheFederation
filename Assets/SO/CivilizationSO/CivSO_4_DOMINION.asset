  Decription: "In the gamma quadrant the Changelings where hunted by non-changelings
    a.k.a the solids. In their bitterness, the Changelings, founded the Dominion.
    Now known as The Founders, they breed genetically engineered beings like the
    Vorta and the Jem\xB4hadar. The latter became an army that subjugated every other
    race in the gamma quadrant one by one. In the end the entire galaxy will be ruled
    by the Dominion so that no Changeling needs to fear again. Powerful polaran beam
    weapons were made to fire though shields, creating heavy damage. However it was
    shown this worked only with minor races, as all major empires, found quick ways
    to adapt, technologically. The Dominion, however, has other means for galactic
    dominion as well. The Changeling shape-shift to any form, which makes them very
    good in espionage. If working, the Dominion also uses the diplomatic skill of
    cunning Vorta to create valuable alliances and persuade minors to join them,
    without a fight. The Jem\xB4hadar, dependent on Ketracel-While, are among the
    best ground troops an empire can have and are sent if diplomacy fails. After
    2000 years of Dominion rule without challengers, there are no species especially
    skilled in technological advancement, which is the biggest flaw of this empire.
    Both Vorta and Jem\xB4hadar where designed to view the Founders as near-mythical
    gods. They know: VICTORY IS LIFE!"
