  Decription: 'The United Federation of Planets is a coalition of worlds bound by
    a mutual desire for peace, the pursuit of scientific understanding, and trade.
    By far however, the most numerous of the Federation races is one of the founding
    members, the Humans of Sol. The people of the Federation live in a society based
    on the values of liberty and equality. Their strength lies in extremely effective
    research, which grants them fast access to new technologies. Their high-quality
    products come at the expense of high resource costs, however. Because of their
    moral convictions, they quickly show weaknesses in the field of espionage and
    sabotage by Starfleet intelligence. However when under attack, some citizens
    of the Federation were known to effectively change their attitude to the ends
    justify the means. With a fleet of well-rounded starships, the Federation is
    equally likely to be seen conducting trade, exploration, humanitarian, and diplomatic
    missions, as they are to be seen conducting military patrols and combat maneuvers.
    Starfleet is capable of ending battles, but do not want to start them. OUR CONTINUING
    MISSION: TO EXPLORE STRANGE NEW WORLDS, TO SEEK OUT NEW LIFE AND NEW CIVILIZATIONS,
    TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO ONE HAS GONE BEFORE!'
