  Decription: The Ornarans have the unique ability to create a significant electrical
    discharge from their hands. This is produced at great strain to the Ornaran but
    can incapacitate the unwary. The Ornarans have been known to use this ability
    to commandeer ships and supplies to feed their collapsing economy.
