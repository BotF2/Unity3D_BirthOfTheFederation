  Decription: The Kazon have some level of sophistication, but rely on raiding and
    the intimidation of other races to obtain their technology. There are distinct
    social divisions in Kazon culture, which will make diplomacy difficult, as favoring
    one faction over another could result in a substantial shift in political power.
    But their shipbuilding expertise would be of particular value to the military.
