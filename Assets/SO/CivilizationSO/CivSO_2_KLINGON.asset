  Decription: The Klingons are some of the most feared warriors in the galaxy. Their
    quest for glory and honor in battle makes them masters in the field of combat;
    be it in ground or space-based combat, their weapons arm quickly and strike hard.
    Some of their warships possess cloaking devices, with which the Klingons strike
    from the shadows at their prey. Their vigorous industrial forges process countless
    masses of raw materials, keeping their resource-hungry war machine running, whilst
    gigantic hunting parties guarantee the population's food supply. However, all
    things that do not directly serve battle are of lower importance to them and
    thus are less effective. The Klingons consider espionage a cowardly and dishonorable
    act, but are willing to defend themselves through internal security as necessary.
    Since Klingon engineers and scientists are not that qualified, you better conquer
    other words in order not to fall behind, in comparison to other empires. Minor
    empires, especially other warmongers respect the Klingon Empire. WHEN FOLLOWING
    THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, EVERYDAY IS A GOOD DAY TO DIE!
