  Decription: The Arkarians began a trend towards a more egalitarian society in 2369.
    They are formally allied with the Federation and jointly maintain the Remmler
    Array which is in orbit of their home world and the Arkaria Base which is on
    the planets surface. These facilities are used to keep a very close watch on
    the Cardassian border which is fairly close.
