  Decription: There are many quantum realities. In one, called the mirror universe,
    there is an evil Federation, the Terran Empire. Many times the Traveler influenced
    this universe, something happened that merged this universe with ours. The Terran
    Empire now competes with the Federation and other Empires in this milky way.
    The Terran Empire is driven by conquest and will destroy or enslave you if you
    do not bend to their will. While having almost identical ships as the Federation,
    they have a higher firepower. Science however is no longer as much of a priority
    or strength as it is to the Federation. Since the TE is not diplomatic smaller
    races do not trust the TE, but they fear it. Their defensive Intelligence is
    not very good, as they are always traitors. The expansion of the Terran Empire
    is always done by conquest and subjugation, however sometimes the Empire prefers
    allies, if they are more powerful than themselves. LONG LIVE THE EMPIRE!
