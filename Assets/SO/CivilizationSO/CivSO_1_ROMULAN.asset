  Decription: To outsiders, the Romulans are an enigmatic race. To the Romulans,
    however, other races have hardly any mystery left, for their talented intelligence
    agency, the Tal Shiar, has solved each of those mysteries. Romulan interests
    are protected by a veil of secrecy and covertness, just as their ships are hidden
    from prying eyes by powerful cloaking technologies. Their ships move undetected
    in groups until they are close to their unsuspecting victim, before decloaking
    and destroying their target in the ambush. Reports on Romulan society show it
    functions on exceptional research achievements. The basic supply of energy and
    food for the populace is sufficient to meet day-to-day needs, and is rigorously
    regulated to be resource-saving, as are their fleet maintenance costs; Romulan
    fleets expect to decimate the enemy before they have any chance at mounting a
    defense. In the 24th century, the Romulans became famous for their powerful and
    cost/performance efficient D'deridex class warbirds, which can however be build
    only slowly, so you shouldn't start a long, or even a multi-border war. Better
    use the deceptiveness of the Tal Shiar. WHEN KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, BEING UNKNOWN
    MEANS TO BE UNCONQUERABLE.
