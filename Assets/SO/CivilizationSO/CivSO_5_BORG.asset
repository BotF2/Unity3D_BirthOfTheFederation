  Decription: 'We are the Borg. You will be assimilated. The Borg are/were a pseudo-species
    of cybernetic beings, or cyborgs, from the Delta Quadrant. No single individual
    truly existed within the Borg Collective (with the sole exception of the Borg
    Queen), as all Borg were linked into a hive mind. Their ultimate goal was the
    attainment of ''perfection'' through the forcible assimilation of diverse sentient
    species, technologies, and knowledge. In addition to this stronghold in the Delta
    Quadrant, the Borg also dispatched vessels throughout the galaxy via transwarp
    conduits. When the Borg encounters other species and new technologies, they will
    assimilate both the crew and the ship as well, adding their distinctiveness to
    their own. Individual drones have demonstrated puzzlement at other species''
    unwillingness to be assimilated, the drones believing in the superiority of their
    way of life. In fact the Borg are twice as powerful as any other empire, since
    their cubes are gigantic and almost unbeatable, so: RESISTANCE IS FUTILE!'
