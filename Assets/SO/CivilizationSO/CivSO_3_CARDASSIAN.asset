  Decription: The Cardassians use any means necessary to ensure the absolute loyalty
    of their subjects. A national indoctrination, mixed with effective control methods,
    promotes an unconditional belief in the Cardassian systems and work ethics, which
    results in exceptional industrial and mining capacity. These state-promoted plants
    clearly work far more effectively than their food and energy installations however,
    and their research advances at a slow rate. Their intelligence services, the
    Obsidian Order, is their biggest strength, it is known as to be the best of the
    galaxy. Not even a Cardassian Gul, can order a soup without the Order knowing
    it. And sometimes people die, after doing the wrong thing... sabotaging other
    empires military installations, is also a specialty of the Obsidian Order. Cardassian
    ships continue the principle of community-controlled actions in space. Individually
    not very efficient, they are developed to attack in tight formations. The individual
    does not count, only the state does. FOR CARDASSIA!
