  Description: Orbital batteries are mainly a defensive measure but can be used to
    blockade of a wormhole or transwarp hub. Their effectiveness is maximized when
    used in conjunction with other defensive systems, but they are vulnerable to
    tactics such as sabotage, coordinated fleet action, or the exploitation of weak
    points (e.g., power sources or control systems).
